# Notes
This file is a collection of notes for things that need to be done or fixed. It serves as an idea bank where I jot down tasks or thoughts as they come to mind. Most of these issues are typically resolved on their own over time, and the list often goes unnoticed once completed.


### Working on right now
- Home screen combine the backups, charts and drives to a nice big thing
    - Convert some of the chart to driving gauges with single value or other charts. 
    - Also could combine some of them?
    - Backups kind of dull, give it some life and readability

    - Loading
        - Unify acorss site
        - Do not block actions if not absolutely necessary
        - Add and remove block should be util


## Features
### Feature ideas
- General UI
    - Inputs
        - Match the color of default placholder and the custom ones.
        - Search input
    - Loading placeholers
        - Make them 100vh. It feels better when its overkill because it allows to scroll and is clearer for the user?
    - Navigation  
        - Highlight link when page is open to show location  
            - Not sure if needed, but could be improved  
    - Forms and inputs
        - Custom placeholders (get rid of generic ones and add missing ones)
        - Custom Password Field  
            - Nothing fancy, maybe not even a component  
            - Change input type when clicking on a button with icon on the right  
            - Toggle between password <-> text  
        - Custome type-select
        - Custom Select  
            - Tab select and arrow keys select value  
        - Since not using form element implement submit from inputs elseway.
    - Modals  
        - Finish the modal windows:  
            - Duplicate  
            - Revamp details modal:  
                - Long and number date, week  
                - Table-like category spread out  
            - .init() or similar that setups a loading animation
                - Cleared when .open()
    - Add a class to app device is touch similar to dark mode
        - Make similar with dark mode
        - Useful to keep buttons always visible on touch  
        - At least watch list has a cards and "all title list" which need this
        - Also hover effects could be removed with it?
    - Notification
        - Add the capability to have multiple notifications
    - Colors
        - The positive green and warning yellow could be toned down to make readability with white text better
        - Stolen color palette that looks nice
            - #f99e1c  
            - #e56528  
            - #425d94  
            - #2c3361  
            - #3d3e40  
        - Nice Colors  
            - #601020  
    - When unmounting a page gracefully cancel the mount request if not answered
    - img
        - loading="lazy"
            - Test how it works and if it works.
            - If it not, maybe try out libararies (preferrable not).
    - Custom carousel
        - Do not allow overscrolling to right (so that just one slide is visible)
            - Dots valid positions based on: amount - (width  / (amount * cardwidth))
        - Physics and not animations?
            - Crash to edge and fall back instead of set to last
        - Key input on just active and not all

- Page specifics
    - Spendings page
        - Filters  
            - Dropdown drag-click multiple? Too much effort?  
            - When screen wide enough, always display filters  
            - Headers, spacing, dropdown for sliders? (Not a fan)  
            - Needs a revamp  
            - Accordion (Haitari) mini toggle instead â†’ allows animation  
        - Loading placeholders on mobile have uneven spacing
        - Edit transaction
            - When modifying trasaction_item count the height of the selected transaction doesn't change when the modal closes.

    - Home page
        - The text-area div is offset as I wan't it, but it partially covers the content below.
            - Make not as tall and set position differently

    - Analytics  
        - Balance over month overlapped
            - See visually how each month differs. 
            - Color gradiant from oldest to most recent
            - How many months? Does the user select or always 6/12/all
        - Add the time slieder to charts with time
            - Allows to zoom on parts of the data, starts to be necessary
        - The Last month/year should be a drop down choise with alternate options
            - kk, 3kk, 6kk, 12kk, all
        - List of total amounts (old style) next to new pie chart
            - Add color dots to clearly show what is what
        - Totals should be removed
            - First thing that catches eye with colors and big font
            - Might cause confusion as to what is initially since so large
        - Could be revamped so that month and year are side by side and change with arrows when screen small
            - Or drop down select range
        - Could be compacted quite a bit, especially since charts can be fullscreened

            - tv, movie, don't care
            - released, not released
            - started...?
        - mobile compability still bad?

        - Better season and episode handling?
            - Seasons side by side with arrows to scroll trhough them?

    - dataQuery.js
        - Follow the same router style as fastapi

    - When adding a tv-show the seasons aren't added because it errors out.
    - Collections shouldn't require an account.
    - Trailers table. Current single triler is quite limiting. Would be cool to have more and actually check out a proper triler, sinse some trailers are not good.


### Feature ideas that might never see the light of day
- Currently none


## Issues
### Waiting to be fixed
- Front end
    - General pile
        - Filterdropdowns not updating when resizing vertically
            - window.eventlistener to update value
        - Ensure everything has a active color in addition to hover. Some improvement made but haven't gone through everything yet.
        - Notification remove the root thingy and just import it
            - Also vue select?
        - When in mobile nav page scrolling isn't disabled
        - Make sure everything has a smooth fade out. 
            - Modal done was major, but the side bar is still atleast missing
            - Go through to find all
        - Filter date slider labels only every 3 months so with transactions on a short timespan it looks odd/broken.
        - v-select width changes when activating causing modal to resize
            - Making my own is on the works.
        - Cannot set 0 as a value for a transaction
            - If I remove check in js and send the 0 as a value mysql throws an error and deletes the transaction items.
            - Be careful when working with this
        - Title details user data updated isn't updated when saving notes on the client side. Need to refresh for it to display.
            - Do not always just set the current date. If the value is the same that it was in the db it doesn't actually update anything.
        
    - Light mode 
        - bg, text, modal, generic button etc. colors need a restructuring. 
            - Try out mirroring what dark mode does instead of brining some stuff to lighter like buttons
            - Light mode colors and hovers suck. Try turning going darker when hovering in light and opposite in dark.
        - Needs quite the overhaul

- Backend and backend related
    - User episodes in mysql might not get deleted on title deletion
    - The api calls aren't cancelled when changing page. Research if they can be cancelled on unmount
    - Delete transaction doesn't use DELETE (not proper REST)


### Delayed to be fixed on a day that might never come
- InfoTooltips positioning is stupid and doesn't detect window borders
    - Make it position itself smartly
    - Currently just left, right and center
    - Would require js and might be a fun project


### Feature or a bug?
- Total log amount is transaction items and not transactions
- In spendings page on a transaction when expanded on mobile it only showws the amounts without the category
    - Or in other words the values are seperated without any labels of what the values mean.
    - Disable when under 777px or just leave it?
- Values aren't cached and are instead queried all the time. For example the options should at the very least be stored?
    - Good placeholders have kind of fixed this, but still worth considerng.
    - Downside of doing this it that the user might be shown data that is not up to date
        - And to fix that we would have to just query the data anyway
        - Is it better to immidiately show old data and change it when the udpated arrives or always show a placeholder?
- Doesn't use the internal fastapi address but the external which is not optimal. 
    - The requests seem to be coming from the client ip and not the webserver so can't do that?
    - Figure out how the requests work
