# Notes
This file is a collection of notes for things that need to be done or fixed. It serves as an idea bank where I jot down tasks or thoughts as they come to mind. Most of these issues are typically resolved on their own over time, and the list often goes unnoticed once completed.

### Next time
- Modal remake
    - Think of a better way to implement the modal. 
    - Way too manual and inconvenient. 
    - Should work more like the native popup where it stops progress and returns a value.
    - Split into two. One for simple confimations with customaizeable texts and one for just slotting stuff into

- Title details
    - poster
        - Also show on mobile layout?
            - Doesn't really fit :/
    - Possibility to requery the images.
        - Started already on fastapi
    - Add a season progress bar or text (or other)
        - The Episodes watched status could be modified to look alike?
        - Layout has to be reworked
    - Tag for not released episodes or a clear way to seperate from released episodes

- Home screen combine the backups, charts and drives to a nice big thing
    - Convert some of the chart to driving gauges with single value or other charts. 
    - Also could combine some of them?
    - Backups kind of dull, give it some life and readability
- Charts should propably be a component
    - Or chart setup and values all handled in the .js file. No thisComponent etc. Just give it the stuff and it will handle it.
    - Although the current setup works fine and is already quite good so propably not worth the effort

- watch list imporve layout for desktop and focus...
    - on the description 
    - on mobile compability

### Features to add
- Navigation
    - link highlight when page open to show where we are.
        - Don't know. Kind of like it as is but it wouldn't hurt.

        - table like category spread out.
    - Simple modal confirms shouldn't connect to display edge if mobile
- New entry QOL
    - autofill buttons or drop down or what ever...
- Filters:
    - Drop down drag click multiple? To much effort?
    - when screen wide enough display the filters always
    - Headers, spacing, drop down for sliders as a solution? Don't like it...
    - Needs a rewamp
    - haitari mini toggleen yhen sijaan jotta sais animoitua

### Known issues
- InfoTooltips positioning is stupid and doesn't detect window borders
    - Make it position itself smartly
- pie chart fullscren button not aligned properly in either fullscreen or normal view
- Tooltips on chart and component not visible enough without border, but with border inconsistant
    - Just add the border, you cant mouse over them so its fine
- Settings apge not accessicble without account but settings are in localstorage.
    - Move to mysql.
- Filterdropdowns not updating when resizing vertically
    - window.eventlistener to update value
- Go through evertyhing to check the they have a click color in addition to hover.
- Modals header and close X shouldn't scroll with content
- Notification remove the root thingy and just import it
    - Also vue select?
- When in mobile nav page scrolling isn't disabled
- Only mobile nav has smooth fadeout
- Doesn't use the internal fastapi address but the external which is not optimal. 
    - The requests seem to be coming from the client ip and not the webserver so can't do that?
- Filter date slider labels only every 3 months so with transactions on a short timespan it looks odd/broken.
- Light mode bg, text, modal, generic button etc. colors need a restructuring. 
    - Try out mirroring what dark mode does instead of brining some stuff to lighter like buttons
    - Light mode colors and hovers suck. Try turning going darker when hovering in light and opposite in dark.
- v-select width changes when activating causing modal to resize
- Turn link buttons so that the buttons act as the link and don't wrap
    - @click="genericLinkFunctionThatICanImport"
    - One for router and one for a
- Cannot set 0 as a value
    - If I remove check in js and send the 0 as a value mysql throws an error and deletes the transaction items.
    - Be carefule when working with this
- User episodes in mysql might not get deleted on title deletion
- The api calls aren't cancelled when changing page. Research if they can be cancelled on unmount
- Home screen charts don't react to esc
- Delete transaction doesn't use DELETE
- Transactions load never ends. 
    - Simple state change when reponse fails and an another v-if element.
- Setting episode wathced/unwatched updates all episodes in the season to be watched on the dom incorrectly even though data on db is correct. Refresh fixes. Check how the data is updated on confirmation.
- Title details user data updated isn't updated when saving notes on the client side. Need to refresh for it to display.
    - Do not always just set the current date. If the value is the same that it was in the db it doesn't actually update anything.
    

### Feature or a bug?
- Total log amount is transaction items and not transactions
- The amount drop down shows without the types when media under 777px wide.
    - Or in other words the values are seperated without any labels of what the values mean.
    - Disable when under 777px or just leave it?
- v-select causes scrolling on modals when opening
    - (Propably no can do?)
- Some cases of improper "post" usage that should be "get"
    - Propably should go through api and unify it with some optimisation at the same time.
- Kun input aktiivinen harkitte sen ihmeen ympärillä jutun takas käyttöön ottoa. Toi et borderista tulee vaan vahvempi näyttää vähän hoopolta.
    - Korjattu ehkä siten että pitää sen border värin sillon kun aktiivinen
    - Jos tabilla ettii muita juttuja niin pitäs muuttaa sillee et tulis sama border kun input fieldeissä?
- Values aren't cached and are instead queried all the time. For example the options should at the very least be stored?
    - Good placeholders have kind of fixed this, but still worth considerng.
    - Downside of doing this it that its not clear when data is up to date and suddenly updates. Now it always shows that it queries.
