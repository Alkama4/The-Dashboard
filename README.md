## Overview
"The Dashboard" is a hobby project of mine to learn web development with a js framework and build a local website with all of the stuff around it. The project uses Vue.js for the front end and FastAPI for the backend (which then uses mysql as a database). Initially the plan was to build a simple spending tracker, but the scope has expanded over time. Right now, it has:
- Manual Spending Tracking: Track and view your spending with basic analysis and graphs.
- Manual Movie and TV Series Tracking: Keep a record of movies and TV shows you've watched or plan to watch.
- Server request and load analysis: display basic info you would wan't to have on a webserver.

As my first time using a JavaScript framework, the code quality especially in older sections reflect that. The main point of this is to learn so the focus is on improving my skills rather than perfection. As the project has evolved, I’ve consistently learned better ways to enhance functionality and maintainability, which I apply as the project continues. However, I don't go out of my way to make these changes.

## License and Usage
This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, so you’re free to use, modify, and distribute it as long as you follow the terms of the license. However, this project is not intended for public use or deployment as it's built just as a local hobby project. It is not designed to be exposed online or used in production environments without significant changes.

This repository contains only the frontend portion of the project and will not have any functionality without a backend. I may eventually push the FastAPI backend code to GitHub as well, but until then its just an empty frontend.

This application is custom-built for my needs and is not suitable for general use. If you choose to fork or use the code, you can do so at your own risk, and you are entirely responsible for any modifications or deployments.
