# The Dashboard

## Overview
"The Dashboard" is a hobby project of mine to learn web development with a js framework and build a local website with all of the stuff around it. The project uses Vue.js for the front end and FastAPI for the backend (which then uses mysql as a database). This is my first time using a JavaScript framework and the codes quality most likely reflects that, especially the older sections.

Initially the plan was to build a simple spending tracker, but the scope has expanded over time. Right now, it has:
- Manual Spending Tracking: Track and view your spending with basic analysis and graphs.
- Manual Movie and TV Series Tracking: Keep a record of movies and TV shows you've watched or plan to watch.
- Server request and load analysis: display basic info you would wan't to have on a webserver.

## License and Usage
This project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. You can use, modify, and distribute this project freely, as long as you comply with the terms of the Apache 2.0 License. However, this project is not intended for public use or deployment and was built as a local, hobby project. It is not designed to be exposed online or used in production environments without significant modification.

This repository contains only the frontend portion of the project and will not have any functionality without a backend. I may eventually push the FastAPI backend code to GitHub as well, but until then its just an empty frontend.

This application is custom-built for my needs and may not be suitable for general use. If you choose to fork or use the code, you do so at your own risk, and you are entirely responsible for any modifications or deployments.
